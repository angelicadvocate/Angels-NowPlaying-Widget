# üéµ Angels-NowPlaying-Widget (Work in Progress)
### ‚ö†Ô∏è This project is still in development and not production-ready.

---

This is a browser-based widget for OBS that displays now playing information from local audio sources using Tuna. It includes four different visual templates, all of which update in real-time from the same data sources.

You can use each template as a separate browser source in OBS, allowing flexibility in your scene design.

Features
- Displays artist and track name
- Album artwork support
- Four included layout templates
- All templates update in sync

More features, customization, and a configuration editor are planned in future versions.
